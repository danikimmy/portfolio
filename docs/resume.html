        <section>
            <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
            <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
                list. Let's make a link to the <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/">Penn State
                    Bulletin</a> (which is where you can read information about classes and
                programs). Here is a list of animals with no specific order. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>bird</li>
                <li>cat</li>
                <li>dog</li>
                <li>giraffe</li>
                <li>monkey</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very
                similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a
                web browser. This is a specific order of what I do most days.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>wake up</li>
                <li>eat breakfast</li>
                <li>go to school</li>
                <li>go to work</li>
