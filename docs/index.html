            <p>Here is some sample HTML to look at. This is a body paragraph with some
                    <strong>inline</strong> code to <em>feature</em> some text. Here is <a
                    href="https://behrend.psu.edu/penn-state-behrend">a link to an external
                    website</a>.</p>
            <p>One of the <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/">best resources</a> for learning HTML
                is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3Schools</a>. Here is a
                reference for <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/">color codes you can use for
                    styling</a>.</p>
            <p>Each p element is a <strong>block</strong> element designed to make a block on the
                page.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>What are block elements good for?</h2>
            <p>The next element after this is a ul, or <q>unordered list</q>. It makes a bulleted
                list. Let's make a link to the <a href="https://bulletins.psu.edu/">Penn State
                    Bulletin</a> (which is where you can read information about classes and
                programs). </p>
            <ul>
                <li>bird</li>
                <li>cat</li>
                <li>dog</li>
                <li>giraffe</li>
                <li>monkey</li>
            </ul>
            <p>How about we look at an ol element, or <q>ordered</q> list? The code looks very
                similar to the <q>unordered</q> list. You have to see the difference by viewing in a
                web browser.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>wake up</li>
                <li>eat breakfast</li>
                <li>go to school</li>
                <li>go to work</li>
                <li>go to sleep</li>
            </ol>
