        <p>Making this website was interesting to say the least. I will say, coding and technology
            is not my cup of tea. I feel like I'm 70 years old trying to understand how technology.
            I think the biggest challenge for new learners is to know the coding and all of the
            symbols you need to add for every little thing you add. You have to make sure that you
            put the exact code to make it look good.Â  Making a website was a bigger advantage for me
            then making a game. I think this because, if I ever start my own business, I can make my
            own website, and I probably won't have use for an online game.</p>
        <p>Some challenges for modifying the layout and organization of each site, is also making
            sure it is organized and easy to understand when you open the website. You want all your
            information to align with each other and I think that was the hardest part, to organize
            it. The skills that are necessary to learn for making a website, is the learning of the
            use of codes, and what will work for each page of your website. Also making sure the
            size of all your images and fonts are where you want them to be.</p>
        <p>Some skills I need to learn better is where to put each code. I think I get confused on
            where to put each code to make it make sense. I think I also need to learn the easy ways
            or the less time consuming ways to put each code, so I am not typing each code one by
            one.</p>
        <p>Overall, it was an experience but I am glad I learned it. Now anytime I need to do this
            in real life experience or in another class, I will be familiar with doing it. I am
            happy about the way my website turned out. I love all the colors I did and how it is all
            about me.</p>
